# Group & Feature Canvas (Final v2)

This package fixes:
- Sidebar resizing (drag the vertical handle between the sidebar and canvas)
- Collapsible sidebar sections using <details> (Data, Add, Visibility & Notes, Help)
- Notes per group/feature with modal editor and popover on hover (toggleable)
- Clicking a node centers camera and toggles visibility of that node's connections
- Clicking sidebar items centers camera and highlights in the sidebar
- Looser clustering and correct mouse coordinates

Open index.html in a modern browser. Import sample.json or your JSON to populate the canvas.
